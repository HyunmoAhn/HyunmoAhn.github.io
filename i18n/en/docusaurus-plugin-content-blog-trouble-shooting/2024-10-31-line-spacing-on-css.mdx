## Introduction

In CSS, line-height is used to adjust line spacing. However, in a project I worked on,
there was a requirement to support line-spacing. This article explains how to implement line-spacing using CSS.

import { LinePaddingExample, LinePlayground } from '@site/src/code-snippet/lineSpacing/index.tsx'

<LinePaddingExample />

## Cheat Sheet

Unlike line-height, which applies padding both above and below the text, line-spacing applies padding only between lines.
The difference here is that line-spacing does not add padding at the beginning and end of the text block.

You can implement line-spacing using margins.

```tsx
const lineHeight = 20; // origin line-height
const lineSpacing = 10;
const margin = - (lineSpacing / 2);

const LineSpacingText = () => {
  return (
    <p style={{
      // highlight-start
      marginTop: `${margin}px`,
      marginBottom: `${margin}px`,
      lineHeight: `${lineHeight + lineSpacing}px`,
      // highlight-end
    }}>
      Hello, World!
    </p>
  );
};
```


## Playground

## Additional Story

There isn't much more to say about the topic of line-spacing.
If you have the idea of "Can it be implemented in CSS?", it's a difficulty level that can be sufficiently implemented.

The key to this idea is that while `line-height` applies padding both above and below, `line-spacing` applies padding only between lines.
Therefore, even in the case of `line-height`, the spacing between lines is the same as the `line-spacing` padding,
and the difference is the presence or absence of padding on the first and last lines.
To bridge this difference, you use margins to reduce the value by `line-spacing / 2`.

In general web development, if such a `line-spacing` requirement comes up,
it is better to somehow persuade in another direction or propose an alternative.
In my case, although it was on the web, I had to create a design tool that perfectly matched a screen developed native,
and I had to satisfy the special specification of `line-spacing`, so I used this method.
It is not recommended to use this method simply to meet design requirements.
Nevertheless, I hope this article helps developers who need to meet similar requirements.
